TLDR: [Play it here !](https://alcalyn.github.io/openhex/#/)

Openhex is a turn-based minimal strategy game.
You have to kill your opponents and capture the whole island !

It is my first ReactJS project.

I translated the game and used [Weblate](https://weblate.org)
to translate it, coupled with [i18next](https://www.i18next.com).
I set up [my own Weblate instance](https://weblate.tru.io/projects/openhex/).

I tried [ElectronJS](https://electronjs.org/) to build a desktop application,
and [Expo](https://expo.io/) to build a mobile application
from a [react-native project](https://github.com/alcalyn/openhex-mobile):
just hacked the thing by using a WebView that links to my project ;)
